The title of Golden city rests with none other than Amritsar as this city ropes everyone into its inviting and irresistible  magnetism. The most famed and exalted Golden Temple aces the list of places of attractions. The sight of this impeccable structure is overwhelmingly marvelous as the sparkling galore of gold gilded atop the temple sends you agape and eventually calmness surfaces your being as you mellow down in the ambience of the place.
Jallianwala Bagh is paid a visit without fail by every Indian to pay reverence to the brave hearts of our glorious land who were unabashedly executed by barbarians. It was established by the thoughtful authorities under government of India back in 1951 to commemorate the brazen massacre where now on your visit you feel humbled and unpretentious , such are the vibes that reverberates from this place.
The place is not far from the capital territory and travel is hassles free and enjoyable. 
A short stint getaway welcomes you to immerse yourselves in city of splendor .
